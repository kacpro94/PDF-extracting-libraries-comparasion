You have only yourself and you had better work back to the last line now, in the dark or not in the dark, and cut it away and hook up the two reserve coils. So he did it. It was difficult in the dark and once the fish made a surge that pulled him down on his face and made a cut below his eye. The blood ran down his cheek a little way. But it coagulated and dried before it reached his chin and he worked his way back to the bow and rested against the wood. He adjusted the sack and carefully worked the line so that it came across a new part of his shoulders and, holding it anchored with his shoulders, he carefully felt the pull of the fish and then felt with his hand the progress of the skiff through the water. I wonder what he made that lurch for, he thought. The wire must have slipped on the great hill of his back. Certainly his back cannot feel as badly as mine does. But he cannot pull this skiff forever, no matter how great he is. Now everything is cleared away that might make trouble and I have a big reserve of line; all that a man can ask. \"Fish,\" he said softly, aloud, \"I'll stay with you until I am dead.\"\n",

    "[52] He'll stay with me too, I suppose, the old man thought and he waited for it to be light. It was cold now in the time before daylight and he pushed against the wood to be warm. I can do it as long as he can, he thought. And in the first light the line extended out and down into the water. The boat moved steadily and when the first edge of the sun rose it was on the old man's right shoulder. \"He's headed north,\" the old man said. The current will have set us far to the eastward, he thought. I wish he would turn with the current. That would show that he was tiring. When the sun had risen further the old man realized that the fish was not tiring. There was only one favorable sign. The slant of the line showed he was swimming at a lesser depth. That did not necessarily mean that he would jump. But he might. \"God let him jump,\" the old man said. \"I have enough line to handle him.\" Maybe if I can increase the tension just a little it will hurt him and he will jump, he thought. Now that it is daylight let him jump so that he'll fill the sacks along his backbone with air and then he cannot go deep to die.\n",

    "[53] He tried to increase the tension, but the line had been taut up to the very edge of the breaking point since he had hooked the fish and he felt the harshness as he leaned back to pull and knew he could put no more strain on it. I must not jerk it ever, he thought. Each jerk widens the cut the hook makes and then when he does jump he might throw it. Anyway I feel better with the sun and for once I do not have to look into it. There was yellow weed on the line but the old man knew that only made an added drag and he was pleased. It was the yellow Gulf weed that had made so much phosphorescence in the night. \"Fish,\" he said, \"I love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before this day ends.\"\n",

    "Up to this point we have pretended that each dimension is logically independent from all the other dimensions. In particular, dimensions have been assumed to be independent of time. Unfortunately, this is not the case in the real world. While dimension table attributes are relatively static, they are not fixed forever. Dimension attributes change, albeit rather slowly, over time.\n",
    "Dimensional designers must engage business representatives proactively to help determine the appropriate change-handling strategy. We can't simply jump to the conclusion that the business doesn't care about dimension changes just because its representatives didn't mention it during the requirements process. While we're assuming that accurate change tracking is unnecessary, business users may be assuming that the data warehouse will allow them to see the impact of each and every dimension change. Even though we may not want to hear that change tracking is a must-have because we are not looking for any additional development work, it is obviously better to receive the message sooner rather than later.\n",
    "When we need to track change, it is unacceptable to put everything into the fact table or make every dimension time-dependent to deal with these changes. We would quickly talk ourselves back into a full-blown normalized structure with the consequential loss of understandability and query performance. Instead, we take advantage of the fact that most dimensions are nearly constant over time. We can preserve the independent dimensional structure with only relatively minor adjustments to contend with the changes. We refer to these nearly constant dimensions as slowly changing dimensions. Since Ralph Kimball first introduced the notion of slowly changing dimensions in 1994, some IT professionals in a never-ending quest to speak in acronymese-have termed them SCDs.\n",
    "For each attribute in our dimension tables, we must specify a strategy to handle change. In other words, when an attribute value changes in the operational world, how will we respond to the change in our dimensional models? In the following section we'll describe three basic techniques for dealing with attribute changes, along with a couple hybrid approaches. You may decide that you need to employ a combination of these techniques within a single dimension table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type 1: Overwrite the Value\n",
    "With the type 1 response, we merely overwrite the old attribute value in the dimension row, replacing it with the current value. In so doing, the attribute always reflects the most recent assignment.\"\"\"\n",

Przedstawiono tutaj także aktualne badania rynku samochodów używanych w Polsce. Zawarto również istotę problemu, z jakim kupujący oraz sprzedający muszą mierzyć się przy zawieraniu transakcji.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1 Historia rynku motoryzacyjnego w Polsce\n",
    "Na kształt współczesnego rynku samochodów używanych w Polsce miało wpływ wiele czynników historycznych oraz gospodarczych. Jednym z kluczowych było znacznie późniejsze wejście Polski w erę motoryzacji w stosunku do reszty świata.\n",
    "W okresie Polskiej Rzeczypospolitej Ludowej produkcja samochodów osobowych w Polsce była ograniczona i średnio rozwinięta, co wynikało z niskiego rozwoju technologicznego oraz centralnie planowanej gospodarki. Produkcja już wtedy była znacznie niższa niż w krajach zachodu. Dla przykładu, w roku 1985 Polska wyprodukowała 283 tys. samochodów osobowych, a w tym samym czasie produkcja we Włoszech wyniosła 1,2 mln, we Francji 2,6 mln, a w USA-8 mln. Głównymi ośrodkami produkcji w tamtych czasach były rodzime zakłady motoryzacyjne, takie jak Fabryka Samochodów Osobowych (FSO) w Warszawie (produkująca m.in.: Poloneza, Fiata 125p, Syrenkę) oraz Fabryka Samochodów Małolitrażowych (FSM) w Bielsku- Białej i Tychach (produkcja kultowego Polskiego Fiata 126p). To właśnie te fabryki odgrywały kluczową rolę w zaspokajaniu popytu na samochodu osobowe. Świadczy o tym liczba zarejestrowanych w kraju samochodów osobowych w 1989 roku, która wyniosła 4,85 mln, z czego aż około 4 mln stanowiły pojazdy produkcji krajowej - w tym około 2,2 miliona Polskich Fiatów 126p oraz ponad milion Fiatów 125.\n",
    "Punktem zwrotnym na polskim rynku była zmiana ustroju państwa w 1989 roku. W jej wyniku zakłady produkcji samochodów zostały sprywatyzowane, co otworzyło rynek na kapitał zagraniczny. Decyzje te, postrzegane wówczas jako korzystne z punktu widzenia rozwoju rynku i jego integracji z gospodarką europejską, okazały się katastrofalne dla rodzimych producentów. Polskie fabryki zostały przejęte przez\n",

    "ground_truth_simple_4 = \"\"\"Uniqueness of the Principal Components\n",
    "While in theory the principal components need not be unique, in almost all practical settings they are (up to sign flips). This means that two different software packages will yield the same principal component loading vectors, although the signs of those loading vectors may differ. The signs may differ because each principal component loading vector specifies a direction in p-dimensional space: flipping the sign has no effect as the direction does not change. (Consider Figure 6.14 the principal component loading vector is a line that extends in either direction, and flipping its sign would have no effect.) Similarly, the score vectors are unique up to a sign flip, since the variance of Z is the same as the variance of -Z. It is worth noting that when we use (12.5) to approximate $x_{ij}$ we multiply $z_{im}$ by $\\phi_{jm}$. Hence, if the sign is flipped on both the loading and score vectors, the final product of the two quantities is unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deciding How Many Principal Components to Use\n",
    "In general, an $n \\times p$ data matrix X has min(n-1,p) distinct principal components. However, we usually are not interested in all of them; rather, we would like to use just the first few principal components in order to visualize or interpret the data. In fact, we would like to use the smallest number of principal components required to get a good understanding of the data. How many principal components are needed? Unfortunately, there is no single (or simple!) answer to this question.\n",
    "We typically decide on the number of principal components required to visualize the data by examining a scree plot, such as the one shown in the left-hand panel of Figure 12.3. We choose the smallest number of principal components that are required in order to explain a sizable amount of the variation in the data. This is done by eyeballing the scree plot, and looking for a point at which the proportion of variance explained by each subsequent principal component drops off. This drop is often referred to as an elbow in the scree plot. For instance, by inspection of Figure 12.3, one might conclude that a fair amount of variance is explained by the first two principal components, and that there is an elbow after the second component. After all, the third principal component explains less than ten percent of the variance in the data, and the fourth principal component explains less than half that and so is essentially worthless.\n",
    "However, this type of visual analysis is inherently ad hoc. Unfortunately, there is no well-accepted objective way to decide how many principal components are enough. In fact, the question of how many principal components are enough is inherently ill-defined, and will depend on the specific area of application and the specific data set. In practice, we tend to look at the first few principal components in order to find interesting patterns in the data. If no interesting patterns are found in the first few principal components, then further principal components are unlikely to be of interest. Conversely, if the first few principal components are interesting, then we typically continue to look at subsequent principal components until no further interesting patterns are found. This is admittedly a subjective ap-\"\"\""

      "\n",
      "Maybe if I can increase the tension just a little it will hurt him and he will jump, he thought. Now that it is daylight let him jump so that he'll fill the sacks along his backbone with air and then he cannot go deep to die.\n",
      "\n",
      "[53] He tried to increase the tension, but the line had been taut up to the very edge of the breaking point since he had hooked the fish and he felt the harshness as he leaned back  to  pull  and  knew  he  could  put  no  more  strain  on  it.  I  must  not  jerk  it  ever,  he thought. Each jerk widens the cut the hook makes and then when he does jump he might throw it. Anyway I feel better with the sun and for once I do not have to look into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was yellow weed on the line but the old man knew that only made an added drag  and  he  was  pleased.  It  was  the  yellow  Gulf  weed  that  had  made  so  much phosphorescence in the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Fish,' he said, 'I love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before this day ends.'\n",
